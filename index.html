    <div>

        <div class="articles">

            <article>
                <p>
                    The article is placed where it is because it is located within the div that has class "articles". Class "articles" has a relative positioning,
                    so these articles are placed relative to the nav as a whole.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article>
                
                <p>Same as before, except this time it is lower since articles are box elements that stack on top of each other.
               </p>
            </article>

        </div>

    <aside>
        <p>An aside does not take up a whole row like a box element, so it is able to be positioned on the side of the page.
            It has absolute positioning, so it is relative to the browser screen.
        </p>
    </aside>

    </div>

    <footer>
        <p>This has fixed positioning, so it's position is fixed to the screen and will not move even
            if the user scrolls away.
        </p>
    </footer>

</body>
